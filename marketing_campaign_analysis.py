# **Marketing Campaign Analysis**

## **Problem Definition**

### **The Context:**

 - Customer segmentation is crucial for optimizing marketing strategies and improving the return on investment (ROI). By understanding customer behavior and characteristics, businesses can create personalized marketing campaigns that cater to the specific needs and interests of different customer groups. This approach can significantly enhance customer engagement, increase sales, and improve overall customer satisfaction. In today's competitive market, personalized communication and targeted marketing are essential for maintaining a competitive edge. Understanding customer segmentation helps businesses utilize their resources more efficiently by targeting specific groups with tailored marketing strategies. It can lead to higher engagement rates, increased sales, and improved customer retention. Effective customer segmentation allows businesses to address the unique needs and preferences of different customer groups, resulting in more effective marketing campaigns and better allocation of marketing budgets.

### **The objective:**

 - The primary goal is to identify the best possible customer segments using unsupervised learning techniques such as dimensionality reduction and clustering. By analyzing the given customer dataset, the objective is to group customers based on common characteristics, which can then be used to tailor marketing efforts and improve business outcomes.

### **The key questions:**

* What are the most significant factors that differentiate customer groups?
* How can we effectively segment the customer base using the provided dataset?
* What insights can be derived from the segmented customer groups to enhance marketing strategies?
* How can these customer segments be used to optimize marketing campaigns and improve ROI?




### **The problem formulation**:

- Using data science techniques, specifically unsupervised learning methods like clustering and dimensionality reduction, we aim to segment the customer base into distinct groups. These segments should reflect common characteristics and behaviors that can be leveraged to create targeted marketing campaigns. The analysis will involve exploring the dataset, identifying key features, applying clustering algorithms, and interpreting the results to derive actionable insights.

------------------------------

## **Important Notes**

- This notebook can be considered a guide to refer to while solving the problem. The evaluation will be as per the Rubric shared for the Milestone. Unlike previous courses, it does not follow the pattern of the graded questions in different sections. This notebook will give you a direction on what steps need to be taken in order to get a viable solution to the problem. Please note that this is just one way of doing this. There can be other 'creative' ways to solve the problem and we urge you to feel free and explore them as an 'optional' exercise.

- In the notebook, there are markdown cells called - Observations and Insights. It is a good practice to provide observations and extract insights from the outputs.

- The naming convention for different variables can vary. Please consider the code provided in this notebook as a sample code.

- All the outputs in the notebook are just for reference and can be different if you follow a different approach.

- There are sections called **Think About It** in the notebook that will help you get a better understanding of the reasoning behind a particular technique/step. Interested learners can take alternative approaches if they wish to explore different techniques.

## **Important Insights from EDA and Data Preprocessing**

What are the the most important observations and insights from the data based on the EDA and Data Preprocessing performed?

## Preparing Data for Segmentation

### Dropping columns that we will not use for segmentation

The decision about which variables to use for clustering is a critically important decision that will have a big impact on the clustering solution. So we need to think carefully about the variables we will choose for clustering. Clearly, this is a step where a lot of contextual knowledge, creativity, and experimentation/iterations are needed.

Moreover, we often use only a few of the data attributes for segmentation (the segmentation attributes) and use some of the remaining ones (the profiling attributes) only to profile the clusters. For example, in market research and market segmentation, we can use behavioral data for segmentation (to segment the customers based on their behavior like amount spent, units bought, etc.), and then use both demographic as well as behavioral data for profiling the segments found.

Here, we will use the behavioral attributes for segmentation and drop the demographic attributes like Income, Age, and Family_Size. In addition to this, we need to drop some other columns which are mentioned below.

* `Dt_Customer`: We have created the `Engaged_in_days` variable using the Dt_Customer variable. Hence, we can drop this variable as it will not help with segmentation.
* `Complain`: About 95% of the customers didn't complain and have the same value for this column. This variable will not have a major impact on segmentation. Hence, we can drop this variable.
* `day`:  We have created the `Engaged_in_days` variable using the 'day' variable. Hence, we can drop this variable as it will not help with segmentation.
* `Status`: This column was created just to get the `Family_Size` variable that contains the information about the Status. Hence, we can drop this variable.
* We also need to drop categorical variables like `Education` and `Marital_Status`, `Kids`, `Kidhome`, and `Teenhome` as distance-based algorithms cannot use the default distance like Euclidean to find the distance between categorical and numerical variables.
* We can also drop categorical variables like `AcceptedCmp1`, `AcceptedCmp2`, `AcceptedCmp3`, `AcceptedCmp4`, `AcceptedCmp5`, and `Response` for which we have create the variable `TotalAcceptedCmp` which is the aggregate of all these variables.

### Scaling the Data

**What is feature scaling?**

Feature scaling is a class of statistical techniques that, as the name implies, scales the features of our data so that they all have a similar range. You'll understand better if we look at an example:

If you have multiple independent variables like Age, Income, and Amount related variables, with their range as (18â€“100 Years), (25Kâ€“75K), and (100â€“200), respectively, feature scaling would help them all to be in the same range.

**Why feature scaling is important in Unsupervised Learning?**

Feature scaling is especially relevant in machine learning models that compute some sort of distance metric as we do in most clustering algorithms, for example, K-Means.

So, scaling should be done to avoid the problem of one feature dominating over others because the unsupervised learning algorithm uses distance to find the similarity between data points.

**Let's scale the data**

**Standard Scaler**: StandardScaler standardizes a feature by subtracting the mean and then scaling to unit variance. Unit variance means dividing all the values by the standard deviation.

![SC.png](attachment:SC.png)

1. Data standardization is the process of rescaling the attributes so that they have a mean of 0 and a variance of 1.
2. The ultimate goal to perform standardization is to bring down all the features to a common scale without distorting the differences in the range of the values.
3. In sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler(), centering and scaling happen independently on each feature.

Silhouette score is one of the methods for evaluating the quality of clusters created using clustering algorithms such as K-Means. The silhouette score is a measure of how similar an object is to its cluster (cohesion) compared to other clusters (separation). Silhouette score has a range of [-1, 1].

* Silhouette score near -1 indicates that those samples might have been assigned to the wrong cluster.

DBSCAN is a very powerful algorithm for finding high-density clusters, but the problem is determining the best set of hyperparameters to use with it. It includes two hyperparameters, `eps`, and `min samples`.

Since it is an unsupervised algorithm, you have no control over it, unlike a supervised learning algorithm, which allows you to test your algorithm on a validation set. The approach we can follow is basically trying out a bunch of different combinations of values and finding the silhouette score for each of them.
